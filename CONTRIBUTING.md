## Main Guidelines

- assign yourself if you're working on an issue
- use feature branches
- never push on master or develop

## Workflow

- check the open issues (you can check the priority by looking at the milestone - basic prototype has to be finished first, afterwards all necessary improvements should be implemented. lastly, you could work on the further possibilities for better results.)
- assign yourself to an issue and give it the "in progress" label
- create a feature branch
- while working on the issue, refer to it in the pull requests (e.g. `Refs issue #123: ...`)
- when done, create a pull request to merge your feature branch into develop (including a `closes #123` automatically closes the issue when the PR is merged), request some reviews and update the issue status label
